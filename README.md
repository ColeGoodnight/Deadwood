DEADWOOD

Authors: Cole Goodnight, Vlad Avadanei

This is a Java based recreation of the Deadwood boardgame, built for our object oriented design class. 

It is a first attempt at building a program using the MVC pattern, and includes two different views. There are seperate branches for the GUI and CLI versions of the game. You can also find the UML diagrams in the UML branch.
